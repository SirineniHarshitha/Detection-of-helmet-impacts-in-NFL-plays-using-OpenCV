# Detection-of-helmet-impacts-in-NFL-plays-using-OpenCV
**INTRODUCTION**
The National Football League (NFL) has partnered up with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to create the “Digital Athlete,” a virtual image of a composite NFL player that the NFL will use to simulate game situations to try and better anticipate and avoid player injury. The NFL is currently addressing the need for a computer vision device to identify on-field helmet impacts as part of the “Digital Athlete” platform.
The aim of our project is to detect the bounding boxes in the images, develop a computer vision model that automatically detects helmet impacts that occur on the field, then we’ll display the count  of the impact .
**DATA OVERVIEW**
This notebook provides an overview of the data and some examples of how to access and conduct some initial plotting of the data that has been provided. There are three different types of data provided for this problem:
**Image Data:** Almost 10,000 images and associated helmet labels for the purpose of building a helmet detection computer vision system.
**Video Data:** 120 videos (60 plays) from both a side-line and endzone point of view (one each per play) with associated helmet and helmet impact labels for the purpose of building a helmet impact detection computer vision system.
**Impacts count:** This is to count the number of impacts generated in the video.
